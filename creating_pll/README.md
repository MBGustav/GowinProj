# Using built-in sample of PLL


This example provides a basic overview of PLL(Phase-Locked Loop) feature in the TANG NANO 9K FPGA development board.



## Prerequirements
To ensure his correct use. It is necessary to follow-up  [Toolchain Manual Instalation](https://learn.lushaylabs.com/os-toolchain-manual-installation/). After that, the following commands will synthetize in the board 
```bash
make all
# Plug the USB-Cable to the FPGA.
make load
```
